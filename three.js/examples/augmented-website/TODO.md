# Nice Url for augemented-webpages
- then support on external site - try to get nice url
- include that in webxr.io - little AR logo in bottom right - try clean url
  - keep on their URL
  - if click then go webxr.io/ar
  - can i put that in the github readme.md ?
  - here goes in iframe with the augmented-webpages examples
  - and url remains simple
  - no need to move files
